Description: This Notebook will prompt the user for a basemap they would like to replace, and a basemap to replace it with. Then the notebook will loop through all of the web maps the user has access to, it will look for the selected basemap, and replace it with the selected replacement basemap.

Created on: 7/1/24

Purpose: The purpose of this notebook is to streamline the workflow of updating the basemaps that are used in web maps. Many users have selected our local imagery as the basemap in their web maps, and as that imagery ages, it is important to update it with the updated imagery. This will allow the user to define the basemap they want to replace, a basemap to replace it with, then loop through all of the web maps the user has access to, and update the web maps with the selected replacement basemap.

Parameters:

    Title of the basemap you want to replace.

    ItemID of the basemap you want to replace it with.
